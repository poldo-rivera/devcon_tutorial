                Oy Bossing kamusta ang buhay-buhay?<br><br>

                My name is <strong>Poldo R. Almoguera</strong>, <strong>22 years old</strong> from <strong>Brgy. Metolza, Naujan, Oriental Mindoro</strong>. I am passionate about studying different languages to familiarize them as well as enjoying my life and living it to the fullest BWAHAHHAHA, and also I enjoy playing online games and watching videos in my free time. I have this hidden talent that I kept since I was born to this beautiful universe but I wished I should have been born in different dimension like Konoha Village tapos ako yong Hokage. Yes, and so my hidden talent is I can read your minds che! HAHAHHAHA <br><br>

                Currently, I am a <strong>3rd year student of the City College of Calapan</strong> taking the program - <strong>Bachelor of Science in Information System</strong>, where I am focusing on major subjects but I also exert effort on minors but not that much. My journey in CCC and in my chosen program started when me and my childhood friend decided to take some thrills in college like coding but due to "personal" reasons he passed out charrr, he stopped studying and I won't tell you why he did that because as I said earlier I can read your minds so I also mind that you don't mind even if I tell you why his mind gone CRAZYYYYY! <br><br>

                In addition to my professional and academic pursuits (eyyyy!), I am also involved in illegal drug operations HAHHAHHAHAH char, I am currently taking a <strong>TESDA program</strong>, <strong>JAVA Programming</strong> but I don't think I can get that NC III kasi nga we need to pay more or less 24K to take the examination. I believe in the saying <strong>"Time is Gold"</strong>, which drives me to get to school everyday as early as I can. (wag nyo na akong kontrahin, moment ko ari) <br><br>

                I am always eager to learn new things and take on challenges that push me out of my comfort zone kasi sabi nga nila hindi ka daw magagrow kung hindi ka aalis sa comfort zone mo. My goal is to use my knowledge and this program-program, coding-coding in my future work kung papalarin (sinampal) and as what everyone wants, I also want to become successful someday, and I am excited about the opportunities that lie ahead. <br><br>
                
                Thank you for taking the time to learn a little about me and always remember mwah-mwah kayo sakin!</p>
